Title: Grammatical Object-Oriented Plots
Description: Provides an object-oriented abstraction based on the
             Grammar of Graphics and implements the API using ggplot2.
             While the entire API is object-oriented, the term applies
             particularly to the support of arbitrary, abstract data
             types, which are not necessarily data frames and are not
             necessarily stored in memory.
